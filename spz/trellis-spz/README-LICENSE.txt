Most of the Trellis code is under MIT lincense, allowing for a full-commercial use.

HOWEVER, Trellis uses several modules that disallow commercial use, and only allow for research / evaluation purpouses.
This means that you are NOT allowed to sell assets generated via Trellis right now.

Other people, including me (Igor) are trying to replace those modules, for alternatives:

If you have info about alternatives that can be easily integrated, please write to Igor on discord:
